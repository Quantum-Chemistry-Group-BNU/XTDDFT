# Spin-adapted TD-DFT for open-shell systems

## Methods

1. TDA for closed-shell systems (singlet and triplet states)

2. X-TDA for open-shell systems ($S_f=S_i+1,S_i,S_i-1$)

## TODOs

1. Davidson diagonalization for X-TDA and XSF-TDA

2. State interaction for treating spin-orbit couplings:
   This is required in many applications such as zero-field splittings for organic and rare-earth systems.

4. Gradients for excited state geometry optimization

5. Non-adiabatic couplings for non-adiabatic dynamics

6. GPU for large systems
