# Spin-adapted TD-DFT for open-shell systems

## Methods

1. TDA for closed-shell systems (singlet and triplet states)

2. X-TDA for open-shell systems ($S_f=S_i+1,S_i,S_i-1$)

## TODOs

1. Davidson diagonalization for X-TDA and XSF-TDA

2. State interaction for treating spin-orbit couplings

3. Gradients

4. Non-adiabatic couplings

5. GPU for large systems
